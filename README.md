Various ROM hacks for Vs System arcade cabinets

If you, like myself, have a red tent cabinet (or any Vs System cabinet) in your home and you prefer to leave it on free play, maybe you've run into this problem: games that are set to free play are always "coined up" which causes them to sit on a static screen waiting for the player to begin their game, which means you don't get to see the cool attract mode that the developers included, plus you have much more risk of screen burn-in if you leave the machine powered on for long periods.

Inspired by Matt Osborn on the KLOV forums, I decided I wanted to hack my red tent games to properly support free play attract mode.

If you have any questions, find me on the KLOV forums. I'm always happy  to help any way I can, as the arcade community has been such a tremendous resource to me and I want to pay it forward if I can.
